# GABI, A Community-Driven Framework for Engineering Inclusive Financial Software for the Elderly

Population aging and the increasing digitalization of financial services have intensified challenges related to the digital inclusion of older adults, who frequently face usability, accessibility, and security barriers when interacting with Internet Banking (IB) platforms. This study aims to develop and validate the GABI Guide (A Welcoming Banking Guide for Older Adults), a set of actionable and evidence-based guidelines to support the design of intuitive, accessible, and secure IB interfaces tailored to older users. A mixed-methods approach was adopted, combining a qualitative diagnostic study with semi-structured interviews conducted with 12 older adults, revealing recurrent difficulties such as fear of making errors, low confidence in digital transactions, and interface complexity, with a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that established the theoretical foundation by selecting 13 primary studies from an initial pool of 2,378 articles. The triangulation of empirical and theoretical evidence informed the construction of the GABI Guide, which was subsequently implemented as an interactive web-based artifact. The results demonstrate the rigor and relevance of the proposed guide: the platform achieved a perfect Lighthouse Accessibility score (100), indicating strong compliance with accessibility best practices, and the validation process showed high levels of acceptance and perceived usefulness, with average evaluation scores above 4.5 (on a 5-point scale) across all assessed dimensions, as well as unanimous recognition of the clarity, didactic quality, and practical relevance of the guidelines for designing digital products for older adults.
